      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p style="color: #0ff">I am the creator behind KerPian Corporation. I specialize in developing interactive narrative experiences, merging art, design, and technology to bring unique worlds to life.</p>
      <p style="color: #0ff">DFrom a very young age, I found creativity to be a way to build, transform, and connect. I am passionate about video games with soul, stories that leave a mark, and projects that dare to break the mold. Every work I create is born with a clear intention: to offer something different, something with character.</p>
      <p style="color: #0ff">In this space, you will find fragments of who I am, reflected in games, ideas, and future projects.</p>
      <p style="color: #0ff">Thank you for being here.</p>
